GitHub said I should add a readme file. Ok then, here goes.
This is a small project inspired by the [original game](https://web.archive.org/web/20110709034319/http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/92827-boxes) that was on the YoYo Sandbox back in the 2000s, when the old GameMaker program was at its peak.
It's gonna take a while to get to the quality of that game.
Main reason I'm doing this is because I'd like to make a 60fps clone of the game with my own added things.
## Contribution
You can help if you want, by forking the repository and making some pull requests. Add new features to the game or bug fixes, it would be great!
